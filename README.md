# KaggleBadge
This is the repository for the KaggleBadge project. 
The idea is to generate small images for competitions hosted on www.kaggle.com. 
The images provide informations such as username or team name and the current position in the leaderboard. 
These images can then be included in markdown to represent a badge and get updated automatically after a certain amount of time to keep the leaderbord position up to date.

The latest deployed version can be found under https://kaggle-badge.herokuapp.com.

### Development
I am not a web developer and this is my first project to get familiar with ruby on rails and web programming. Actually it is used as a testproject and used as a preparation for a university course *agile web development*. 

If you would like to contribute, feel free to fork the repository and submit your changes as pull requests. Thanks in advance :kissing_closed_eyes:
